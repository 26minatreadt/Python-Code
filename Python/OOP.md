Four main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:

1. Abstraction

  Abstraction is the principle of hiding the complex details and showing only essential features of an object. If allows a user to interact with and object's functionality witithout knowing how it works internally.

  in Python, abstraction is achieved through the use of classes and methods. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and it defines a set of attributes and behaviors that the objects will have.

2. Encapsulation

    Encapsulation is the concept if bundling data (attributes) and methods within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to an object's internal state, protecting data integrity.

    In Python, encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers such as public, private, and protected.

3. Inheritance

    Inheritance is the principle of creating a new class based on an existing class. The new class, known as the subclass, inherits attributes and behaviors from the existing class, known as the superclass.

    Python supports single inheritance, where a subclass inherits from a single superclass, and multiple inheritance, where a subclass inherits from multiple superclasses.

4. Polymorphism

    Polymorphism is the principle of allowing objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same class. It enables a single interface to be used for multiple related but different types of objects.

    In Python, polymorphism is achieved through the use of method overriding and method overloading.
